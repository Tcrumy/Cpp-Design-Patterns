This singleton example is based on an example in Umar Lone's
Udemy course titled "Creational design patterns in Modern C++". 
I have left in commented code to allow experimentation with the
different ways to make a singleton thread safe. Running it as-is
uses the Meyers singleton, and as such this logger class is thread
safe. This class uses a lazy instance.
